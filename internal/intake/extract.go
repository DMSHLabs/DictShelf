// "Dicts/English/Oxford.mdx" installs as "Oxford.mdx" at the top of dest

// RAM is one copyBufBytes buffer and one open entry, always. Entries are
// written in the order THE ARCHIVE STORES THEM, on this goroutine. That is not
// cosmetic: a 7z folder is one stream holding several files end to end, so
// reading them in order is linear and reading them backwards means
// decompressing the folder again from its start for each one. A zip is
// indifferent to the order, so one rule serves both.
//
// ctx is checked per buffer rather than per entry, so cancelling a 2 GB import
// stops within a megabyte of the tap instead of at the end of the file that
// made the user cancel. progress, when not nil, is called with the size of
// each chunk written; it is called from this goroutine and must not block.
