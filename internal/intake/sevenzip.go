// ErrEncryptedArchive is an archive whose contents - or whose very list of
// contents - are behind a password. Reported as its own thing because it is
// the one archive failure the user can do something about, and because the
// decompressor's own words for it are not a sentence anybody reads.
var ErrEncryptedArchive = errors.New("archive is password-protected")

// sevenZipArchive reads a .7z. Two properties of the format shape everything
// here, and neither applies to zip:
//
//   - There is no per-file compressed size. Files are packed into FOLDERS
//     (the format's word for a solid block), and only the folder's packed size
//     exists. Entry.Compressed is therefore zero and the ratio check in
//     writeEntry does not fire; the bound that matters is the one that is
//     enforced anyway - each entry is copied through a limit of its DECLARED
//     size, so an entry that inflates past what it promised is truncated and
//     the extraction fails. A bomb has to lie about its size to be a bomb, and
//     that lie is caught while writing rather than by arithmetic beforehand.
//   - Reading is sequential. A folder is one LZMA2 stream holding several
//     files end to end, so reaching the third file means decompressing the
//     first two. bodgit/sevenzip handles this by keeping the folder's
//     decompressor alive between Opens, which makes IN-ORDER reading linear
//     and out-of-order reading quadratic. Extract therefore writes a
//     candidate's files in ARCHIVE order (see extract.go), and this type only
//     has to bound what stays alive while it does.
//
// The plan's prohibition stands: FileHeader.Stream is NOT used to regroup or
// parallelise the work. It is read for exactly one purpose - to know when the
// last folder has been left behind, so its decompressor can be dropped instead
// of accumulating one 16-64 MiB dictionary per folder the extraction touches.
