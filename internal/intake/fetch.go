// Fetching an archive over https.
//
// This is in Go rather than in the Android shell for two reasons. The server
// is a separate process, so it is not bound by the app's
// network_security_config, which means one code path serves every platform
// instead of a Java downloader that exists only on the phone; and a download
// that outlives the activity is exactly what an import needs on a device where
// the page dies on rotation.
//
// A URL reaches here by share, by paste, or by a tap on one of the few hosts
// the Android manifest offers to open (D130, D139). None of those is silent:
// the user handed the link over. So the default is to fetch what they asked
// for from wherever they asked for it, and IMPORT_URL_HOSTS is an opt-in
// restriction for the one case that is not personal - a wudict reachable from
// a network, where the caller pointing the download may not be the user.
//
// The refusals that protect the MACHINE are separate and are not a host list:
// plain http, and any address that resolves to loopback, a private range or a
// link-local block. Those hold whatever IMPORT_URL_HOSTS says, and only
// IMPORT_INSECURE lifts them.

// DownloadDirName is where a fetched archive lands, inside the dictionary
// folder. Deliberately NOT the staging area: staged files are intermediaries
// and are removed when the job ends however it ends, and a download is not an
// intermediary. It is the only copy of a file the user asked for, it took
// minutes to acquire, and whether it survives is their decision
// (IMPORT_KEEP) - which it cannot be if the job's teardown has already taken
// it. Being a plain visible folder is part of the same thought: a user who
// kept the bundle must be able to find it.
// The name itself is dict's, because Discover has to skip this folder and the
// two must agree about which one it is.
