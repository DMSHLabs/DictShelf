# Search

wuDict's main page consists of a search box and a list of results, one accordion section per dictionary.

## The four modes

There are four search type available to pick from the dropdown.

| Mode | It matches | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exact** | the headword itself, ignoring case and accents | you know the word |
| **Prefix** *(default)* | every headword that starts with your text | you know how it begins |
| **Contains** | your text anywhere inside a headword | you know the middle, not the start |
| **Full-text** | words inside the article text, ranked by relevance | you remember the meaning, not the word |

Exact and prefix work immediately, through the dictionary's own index.

Contains and full-text index are not generated automatically. 
You can enable them for specific dictionaries via
the <kbd>☰</kbd> panel, or generate full-text-search indexes for all dictionaries by clicking 
the cogwheel <kbd>⚙️</kbd> in the dictionary panel and then in the expanded box clicking 
<kbd>**⚡️ Enable full-text search for every dictionary…**</kbd>.

!!! info "Accents and case are ignored, spelling mistakes are not"

    `corazon` finds `corazón`, and `OXFORD` finds `Oxford`, in every mode.

    No mode corrects a typo. Contains looks for your text as a literal piece of
    a headword: `orre` finds *correr*, `corer` finds nothing.

??? info "Approximate index size for on a 40,000-entry dictionary"

    | Index | Size | Enables |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Headword | about 2 MB | exact and prefix, accent-insensitive |
    | Contains | about 2.4 MB | substring headword search |
    | Full-text | about 12 MB | search inside article text |

    The headword index is built automatically. `Contain` and `Full-text` are optional,
    per dictionary. The <kbd>☰</kbd> panel shows the real numbers for your own files, not
    these examples.

    An indexed wuDict dictionary is usually **smaller** than the file it came from,
    because article text is compressed.

??? info "How contains works, and its one limit"

    Contains is an FTS5 trigram index over folded headwords. A trigram index
    needs at least three characters. wuDict searches shorter text with a plain
    scan, which is correct but slower.

    Folded means lower case with accents removed. The index stores the folded
    form, so searching for words with accented characters works as expected.

## Full-text search syntax

Full-text mode searches in article *text* and has its own
query language. Exact, prefix and contains treat whatever you type as literal
text. The FTS syntax only applies to full-text search and not to other modes.

Full-text needs the full-text index switched on for the dictionary (the
<kbd>☰</kbd> panel). Dictionaries without it are skipped.

### Several words mean a phrase

When you do a full-text search for e.g. `no pun intended` wuDict reads adjacent 
words the way a lexicographer writes them: **as a phrase, in that specific order**.

_If_ the phrase finds nothing, wudict falls back to proximity search, one step at a
time, and it stops at the first step that has any results:

| Step | What is searched | Example: `no pun intended` finds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 phrase** | the words, adjacent, in that order | *…and, **no pun intended**, he resigned* |
| **2 proximity** | the same words close together, any order | *…clearly **intended** as a **pun**…* |
| **3 words** | the same words anywhere in the article | *…**pun**… (200 words) …**intended**…* |

The widening is never silent. When a dictionary did not find an exact match, its result
header says **phrase not found · words proximity** or **phrase not found ·
words anywhere**, so you always know which FTS mode is used.

### Full-text search query language

When you need to search for an exact phrase only with no fallbacks to proximity search enclose the text in single or double quotes.
**A query containing an operator is run exactly as written and is never widened.**

wuDict switches to this exact reading only when your input contains a quote, a
bare **UPPERCASE** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, or `NEAR(`. Lower-case `and`
is an ordinary word in most languages, and `(coll.)` is ordinary dictionary
notation, so neither changes how a query is read.

Quotes may be `"double"`, `'single'`, or the typographic “double” and
‘single’ pairs your word processor produces when you paste from a
document — all five mean the same thing. An apostrophe is still a letter:
`don't cry`, `l'année` and `dogs' lives` are read as ordinary words, because
a single quote opens a phrase only when it stands at the *start* of a word and
its partner at the *end* of one.

| You type | You get                                                                                             |
| --- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"no pun intended"` | that exact literal phrase — **no** prefix on the last word, and **no** fallback if it finds nothing |
| `'no pun intended'` | the same — single quotes are quotes                                                                 |
| `"no pun intended"*` | the same phrase with the last word left open — also *…no pun intendedly*                            |
| `pun` | every word starting with *pun* — a bare word is always a prefix                                     |
| `"pun"` | the word *pun* only                                                                                 |
| `pun intended` *(inside an operator query)* | both words, anywhere in the article                                                                 |
| `pun AND intended` | the same thing, written out                                                                         |
| `pun OR intended` | either one                                                                                          |
| `pun NOT intended` | *pun*, in articles that do not contain *intended*                                                   |
| `NEAR("pun" "intended", 5)` | the two words within 5 words of each other, any order                                               |
| `NEAR("pun" "intended")` | the same with the default distance of 10                                                            |
| `(pun OR joke) AND intended` | grouping, to any depth                                                                              |

`NOT` has highest priority, followed by `AND`, then `OR`; two operands side by side mean
`AND`. Use parentheses when you want another grouping.

??? example "Examples for `no pun intended`"

    | Goal | Query |
    | --- | --- |
    | That phrase, and only that phrase | `"no pun intended"` or `'no pun intended'` |
    | The phrase, but allow fallback to proximity search if nothing found | `no pun intended` |
    | *pun* and *intended* near each other, either order | `NEAR("pun" "intended", 10)` |
    | *pun* and *intended* in the same article, however far apart | `"pun" AND "intended"` |
    | Either *pun* or *joke*, with *intended* | `(pun OR joke) intended` |
    | *pun* articles that are not about punctuation | `pun NOT punctuation` |

??? example "Patterns that come up in real lexicographic work"

    | Goal | Query |
    | --- | --- |
    | A fixed expression, verbatim | `"faux ami"` |
    | …but not in the linguistics articles | `"faux ami" NOT linguistics` |
    | Two spellings of one term | `"colour blind" OR "color blind"` |
    | A word used with another word, not merely present | `NEAR("bank" "river", 4)` |
    | A definition fragment you half remember | `sudden fear of` |
    | An abbreviation and its expansion in one article | `NEAR("i.e." "that is", 6)` |
    | Every derivative of a stem, exactly | `"lexicograph"*` |
    | Exclude a sense you keep hitting | `crane NOT bird` |
    | Two conditions, one of them loose | `"phrasal verb" AND (idiom OR colloquial)` |

!!! info "Accents, case and the tokenizer"

    Accents and case are ignored here exactly as in the other modes, so
    `"corazon"` finds *corazón* and `"OXFORD"` finds *Oxford*.

    The operators themselves are the exception: they are recognised only in
    capitals. `wage NOT minimum` excludes *minimum*; `wage not minimum`
    searches for the three words *wage*, *not* and *minimum*, which is what
    someone writing in English, Dutch or Latin needs it to do.

    Punctuation inside a quoted phrase is not searched for; it is split on the
    same word boundaries as the text, so `"i.e."` matches *i.e.* and
    `"no-pun-intended"` behaves like `"no pun intended"`.

### What is deliberately not there

-   **No field or column filters.** There is no `headword:` or `definition:`
    prefix; full-text searches the article. `title:foo` is read as the two
    words *title* and *foo*.
-   **No `-word` negation and no leading `NOT`.** `NOT` needs something on its
    left: write `wage NOT minimum`, not `NOT minimum`.
-   **No wildcard inside or at the start of a word.** The star only works at
    the end — `wage*`, `"no pun intended"*`. `*age` and `w*ge` are literal text.
-   **No spelling correction.** Full-text finds the words you typed, and their
    prefixes. A misspelt word finds nothing; [inflected forms](#inflected-words)
    are handled separately, by the lemmatizer.
-   **No regular expressions.**

!!! info "A query never fails"

    Anything wuDict cannot parse — a stray quote, an unbalanced bracket, an
    operator with nothing to operate on — is read as plain words instead of
    refused. You never get a syntax error; at worst you get the ordinary
    three-step search. This is also how you search for the word *OR* itself.

    Very long queries are cut at 128 words, and nesting at 24 brackets deep.

## Inflected words

A search that finds nothing anywhere is not over. wuDict looks the word up in
its list of word forms and searches again for what it finds — *knew* becomes
**know**, *estuviera* becomes **estar** — and a banner says which word it
switched to.

The retry is per dictionary and per language. A dictionary that already
answered is never second-guessed, and a dictionary is only offered its own
language's word forms: Spanish *sale* → **salir** is never asked of an English
dictionary.

**Only English is built in.** Every other language is a small data file you
install, and there are two ways to do it:

-   Click <kbd>**🔤 Lemmatization**</kbd> — in the ⚙ box of the <kbd>☰</kbd> dictionary panel, or on
    the settings page — tick a language, and it downloads. It works in the next
    search; nothing needs restarting. This is the only route on Android.
-   From a terminal, [`wudict lemmas download ru`](../reference/cli.md#lemmas).

??? info "What a language costs, and how to switch this off"

    The page lists each language's download size (a few hundred KB to 2 MB) and
    the memory it uses while loaded (7 MB for English, 90 MB for Slovak) —
    measured, not estimated. Nothing is loaded until a search needs it, and
    only [`MORPH_CACHE`](../reference/configuration.md#morph_cache) languages
    stay in memory at once — 2 on a desktop, 1 on Android.

    `MORPH_CACHE = "0"` switches the whole thing off, which is what you want if
    you would rather a failed search simply stay failed. The lemmatization page
    tells you when it is off rather than letting you download data nothing will
    read.

    Untick a language to delete its file.

## Dictionary search order

The results appear in the order you have defined in the dictionary panel
with the exception that the first dictionary to return a result always maintains 
its first position in the result list.

A **more…** link expands one dictionary to the full entry, with the
dictionary's own layout, fonts, styles and scripts. Nothing is reflowed or
rewritten.

## Cross-references

Click a link inside an article to follow it. wuDict looks in the dictionary you
are reading first, and widens the search to all dictionaries only when that
dictionary has no such entry.


## Shortcuts

| Key or click | Action                                        |
| --- |-----------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>/</kbd> | focus the search box, from anywhere on the page |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | close the <kbd>☰</kbd> panel                              |
| double-click a word in an article | look up selected word                         |
| <kbd>⊞</kbd> | expand / collapse results                     |
| <kbd>⇔</kbd> | switch to a wide layout                 |
| <kbd>☀☾</kbd> | cycle light, dark and automatic theme        |

## The <kbd>☰</kbd> dictionary panel

This is where you configure your dictionaries.

- **Sort** your dictionaries by dragging the <kbd>⠿</kbd> handle, or with the ▲ ▼ ⏫ ⏬
  buttons. Results stream in that order, and the order is remembered.
- **Enable or disable** a dictionary to be included in the 'All dictionaries' search. 
If you disable a dictionary you can still use it by selecting it from the dropdown. 
- **Toggle** `contains` or `full-text` per dictionary, and pack media.
- **Rescan folders** re-reads every dictionary folder without a restart. Use it
  after adding new dictionaries.

## Link straight to a search

The address bar URL includes the search term and search mode, so any result is a link you can bookmark,
share on the same machine, or open from a script.

```
http://localhost:6888/?q=serendipity&mode=prefix&dict=<dictionary_hash>
```

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | the word to search |
| `mode` | `exact`, `prefix`, `contains` or `fts` |
| `dict` | dictionary id, or `all` — [/api/dicts](../reference/api.md) lists the ids |
| `theme` | `light` or `dark`, remembered from then on |

Back and Forward work as expected and preserve navigation history. On Android, the same link works
as `wudict://lookup?q=serendipity` — see [the Android app](../apps/android.md).

## Searching from the console


``` sh title="search in ALL dictionaries"
wudict searchall phubbing

# search in a custom folder
wudict searchall -dict-dir=/another/dir/Babylon phubbing

# return full raw HTML
wudict searchall -format=raw phubbing

# return cleaned-up HTML
wudict searchall -format=clean phubbing
```

``` sh title="search in a single dictionary in the terminal"
wudict lookup   ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx phubbing
wudict prefix   ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx phubb
wudict contains ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx phub
wudict fts      ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx "sudden fear"
```

`contains` and `fts` need a prepared dictionary. `lookup` and `prefix` work on
any file.

!!! warning "The syntax above belongs to `searchall`, not to `fts`"

    `wudict searchall -mode=fts "no pun intended"` is the same search the web UI
    runs: the phrase-first ladder and every operator apply, and `-format` only
    changes how the article is printed.

    `wudict fts <file> <term>` is the single-file, single-question form. It
    reads the term as plain words — the ladder and the operators are not
    applied there, so `"no pun intended"` and `no pun intended` mean the same thing to
    it: articles containing all three words.

    Remember that your shell eats quotes before wuDict sees them. Wrap the
    whole query in single quotes to pass double quotes through:

    ``` sh
    wudict searchall -mode=fts '"faux ami" NOT linguistics'
    wudict searchall -mode=fts 'NEAR("bank" "river", 4)'
    ```
